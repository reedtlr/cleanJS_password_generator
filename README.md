## Sources
Based on a YouTube tutorial small changes made. I created an option for lowercase characters rather than leaving them as a default. I changed all variable staments to var to see if it would still run without errors. I changed the font to something more appealing with Google Fonts. (https://youtu.be/iKo9pDKKHnc)
